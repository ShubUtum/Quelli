## Quelli

The software to manage a social distancing in places under a queue problem.
For use with [Quelli-backend](https://github.com/crasite/Quelli-Backend)

## Inspiration

Queuing to enter a place can create a close contact between people. By making a reservation to each place and manage the queue properly can reduce the chance of getting infected.

## What it does
* Search for nearby store based on your current location
* Search for store based on name
* View the current queue of each store
* Reserve a queue for a timeslot
* View your upcoming reserved queue
* Verify your queue with QRcode

## Challenges we ran into
* It's the first time we used Flutter and Mongo database
* Figuring out what API from the backend would be needed
* Timezone difference between member (Thailand & Germany)

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* We figured out how to use  Flutter and Mongo database
* Functioning teamwork
* Not wasting our free time and actually do something meaningful
